In each case, depending on the $\\ell_0$-norm of the mean change vector, we separately consider dense and sparse regimes. We characterise the boundary between the dense and sparse regimes under the above two tail conditions for the first time in the change point literature and propose novel testing procedures that attain optimal rates in each of the four regimes up to a poly-iterated logarithmic factor. Our results quantify the costs of heavy-tailedness on the fundamental difficulty of change point testing problems for high-dimensional data by comparing to the previous results under Gaussian assumptions. To be specific, when the error vectors follow sub-Weibull distributions, a CUSUM-type statistic is shown to achieve a minimax testing rate up to $\\sqrt{\\log\\log(8n)}$. When the error distributions have polynomially-decaying tails, admitting bounded $\\alpha$-th moments for some $\\alpha \\geq 4$, we introduce a median-of-means-type test statistic that achieves a near-optimal testing rate in both dense and sparse regimes. In particular, in the sparse regime, we further propose a computationally-efficient test to achieve the exact optimality. Surprisingly, our investigation in the even more challenging case of $2 \\leq \\alpha ","tags":null,"title":"Robust mean change point testing in high-dimensional data with heavy tails","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yudong Chen","Tengyao Wang","Richard J.

First, we seek a confidence interval for the changepoint, and second, we estimate the set of indices of coordinates in which the mean changes. We propose an online algorithm that produces an interval with guaranteed nominal coverage, and whose length is, with high probability, of the same order as the average detection delay, up to a logarithmic factor. The corresponding support estimate enjoys control of both false negatives and false positives. Simulations confirm the effectiveness of our methodology, and we also illustrate its applicability on the US excess deaths data from 2017–2020.","tags":null,"title":"Inference in high-dimensional online changepoint detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I will attend the ICMS workshop on Structural Breaks and Shape Constraints in Edinburgh, UK in May 2022 and give a contributed talk at the IMS Annual Meeting in London, UK in June 2022.\n","date":1651276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653350400,"objectID":"22beac7abb2f80f72098a3c3e935174a","permalink":"https://yudongchen88.github.io/post/attending_icms_ims/","publishdate":"2022-04-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/attending_icms_ims/","section":"post","summary":"I will attend the ICMS workshop on [Structural Breaks and Shape Constraints](https://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/2022/structural-breaks-and-shape-constraints) in Edinburgh, UK in May 2022 and give a contributed talk at the [IMS Annual Meeting](https://www.imsannualmeeting-london2022.com/) in London, UK in June 2022.","tags":null,"title":"Attending the ICMS workshop and the IMS Annual Meeting (May/June 2022)","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yudong Chen","Tengyao Wang","Richard J.

The procedure works by performing likelihood ratio tests against simple alternatives of different scales in each coordinate, and then aggregating test statistics across scales and coordinates. The algorithm is online in the sense that both its storage requirements and worst-case computational complexity per new observation are independent of the number of previous observations; in practice, it may even be significantly faster than this. We prove that the patience, or average run length under the null, of our procedure is at least at the desired nominal level, and provide guarantees on its response delay under the alternative that depend on the sparsity of the vector of mean change. Simulations confirm the practical effectiveness of our proposal, which is implemented in the R package **ocd**, and we also demonstrate its utility on a seismology data set.","tags":null,"title":"High-dimensional, multiscale online changepoint detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am excited to join the Department of Statistics at the London School of Economics and Political Science as a research officer from November 2021.
